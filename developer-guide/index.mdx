# Get Started with Data 360 Development

As of October 14, 2025, Data Cloud has been rebranded to Data 360. During this transition, you may see references to Data Cloud in our application and documentation. While the name is new, the functionality and content remains unchanged.

With Data 360, you can consolidate and process large volumes of data from various sources and integrate it with Salesforce CRM data, avoiding data silos. Data 360 uses a lakehouse to store your data and connect it with the Salesforce Platform. You can process data at scale, query the data, and create insights from billions of records. Customer data is unified so that you can create rich insights for customer profiles.

Here are some of the most frequently asked questions when starting to develop in Data 360.

    Check out our new [Quick Start](/docs/data/data-cloud-dev/guide/dc-quick-start.html) tutorial.  
    You can also use our Data 360 Connect API postman collection. Check out the [video](/docs/data/data-cloud-dev/guide/dc-apis-postman.html) on how to set up authorization for the API.

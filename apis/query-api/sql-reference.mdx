# Data 360 SQL Reference

As of October 14, 2025, Data Cloud has been rebranded to Data 360. During this transition, you may see references to Data Cloud in our application and documentation. While the name is new, the functionality and content remains unchanged.

Data 360 SQL supports the Data 360 Query API and the Tableau Hyper API. This reference guide describes Data 360 SQL and how it applies to both APIs.

Use Data 360 SQL to query data in Data 360, answer analytical questions, or derive insights from your data.

Data 360 SQL works with these resources.

-   Integrated apps such as Query Editor, DBeaver, or Tableau
-   Custom apps built with language-specific libraries on Data 360

For more information, see [How Do I Query Data in Data 360?](/docs/platform/data-cloud-query-guide/guide/how-to-query-data-cloud.html) and [Data 360 SQL Query APIs](/docs/platform/data-cloud-query-guide/guide/dc-sql-query-apis.html).

Use Tableau Hyper API to access data in Tableau for analytics and data transformations.

Tableau Hyper API uses Data 360 SQL to complete these tasks.

-   Make data in unsupported data sources accessible to Tableau.
-   Automate custom extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes.
-   Implement rolling window updates or custom incremental updates.

For more information, see the [Tableau Hyper API documentation](https://tableau.github.io/hyper-db/docs/).

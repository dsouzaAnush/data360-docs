# Query Services Status Codes

The Query Services APIs return standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. This document provides details about the status codes and their meanings.

| Status Code | Description | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 200 OK | Request successful | The request was processed successfully and the response contains the requested data. |
| 400 Bad Request | Invalid request | The request was malformed or contained invalid parameters. Check the request syntax and parameters. |
| 403 Forbidden | Authorization failed | The request failed to pass authorization. Verify your authentication credentials and permissions. |
| 404 Not Found | Resource not found | The requested resource (callback ID, verification key, or both) was not found. |
| 422 Unprocessable Entity | Invalid attribute | The attribute name used in fields/filter parameter doesn't exist. Verify the field names in your query. |
| 429 Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded | Too many requests were made in a given time period. Query API supports up to 15 concurrent requests. |
| 500 Server Error | Internal error | An unexpected error occurred on the server. Contact support if the issue persists. |

When an error occurs, the response includes:

-   `error`: Error message describing the issue
-   `errorCode`: Unique identifier for the error type
-   `details`: Additional information about the error (if available)

The following are examples of error code request and responses.

-   All error responses are in JSON format
-   Error messages are designed to be human-readable
-   The `errorCode` field can be used for programmatic error handling
-   Rate limits are enforced per organization

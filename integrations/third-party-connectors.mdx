# Third-Party Connectors

Data 360 provides pre-built connectors for common external data sources, enabling you to ingest or federate data without custom API integration.

<Note>
Third-party connector usage may consume **Data 360 credits** based on data volume and connector type. Review your license entitlements before enabling connectors.
</Note>

## Available Connectors

| Connector | Type | Direction | Protocol |
|-----------|------|-----------|----------|
| **SQL Server** | Database | Inbound | JDBC |
| **OData** | API | Inbound / Outbound | OData v4 |
| **GraphQL** | API | Inbound | GraphQL |
| **Apache Iceberg** | Data Lake | Inbound (federation) | Zero-copy |
| **Airtable** | SaaS | Inbound | REST API |
| **Google BigQuery** | Data Warehouse | Inbound (federation) | Zero-copy |
| **Snowflake** | Data Warehouse | Inbound / Outbound | Zero-copy |
| **Amazon S3** | Cloud Storage | Inbound | S3 API |

### Setup Pattern

Most third-party connectors follow the same general pattern:

1. Navigate to **Data Cloud Setup** → **Other Connectors**
2. Select the connector type and click **New**
3. Enter connection credentials (host, port, authentication)
4. Select objects/tables to import
5. Map source fields to Data 360 data model objects
6. Set a sync schedule (hourly, daily, or on-demand)

<Note>
Each connector has unique configuration requirements. Refer to the connector-specific setup guide in [Salesforce Help](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=data.c360_a_data_ingestion.htm&type=5) for detailed instructions.
</Note>

## MuleSoft Integration

The **Anypoint Connector for Data 360** extends Data 360 into MuleSoft's integration platform, enabling complex data orchestration workflows.

### Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Data Ingestion Automation">
    Use MuleSoft flows to transform and ingest data from any source into Data 360 via the Ingestion API. Ideal for complex ETL pipelines that require data transformation before ingestion.

    ```text Example Flow
    Source System → MuleSoft Transform → Data 360 Ingestion API
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Querying Data Cloud">
    Execute SQL queries against Data 360 from MuleSoft flows to retrieve unified customer profiles, calculated insights, or segment memberships for use in downstream systems.

    ```text Example Flow
    Trigger → Data 360 Query → Transform → Target System
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Customer Profile Search">
    Look up unified customer profiles in Data 360 using the Profile API. Use this for real-time personalization, customer service enrichment, or identity verification workflows.

    ```text Example Flow
    Customer Identifier → Data 360 Profile Lookup → Enrich Response
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Getting Started with MuleSoft

1. Install the **Anypoint Connector for Salesforce Data Cloud** from [MuleSoft Exchange](https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/)
2. Configure a Data 360 connection using your OAuth credentials (see [Quick Start](/getting-started/quickstart))
3. Add Data 360 operations to your MuleSoft flows

<Note>
The MuleSoft connector requires a MuleSoft Anypoint Platform license in addition to your Data 360 license.

# Connector Services

Connector services are the pathways for bringing data into Data 360. Each connector type is optimized for a specific data source pattern.

## When to Use Each

| Connector | Best For | Data Direction | Setup Effort |
|-----------|----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Ingestion API** | Custom integrations, ETL pipelines, server-to-server data | Inbound | Medium — requires schema + auth setup |
| **Mobile & Web App** | Behavioral tracking from apps and websites | Inbound | Medium — requires SDK deployment |
| **Third-Party** | Pre-built sources (SQL Server, Snowflake, BigQuery) | Varies | Low — guided UI configuration |
| **Web SDK** | Website interaction tracking (clicks, page views) | Inbound | Low — CDN script + sitemap |

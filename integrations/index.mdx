# Data 360 Integrations

As of October 14, 2025, Data Cloud has been rebranded to Data 360. During this transition, you may see references to Data Cloud in our application and documentation. While the name is new, the functionality and content remains unchanged.

Learn about how data is ingested, connected, and integrated with Data 360 through connectors, connector services, integrations, enterprise data, and strategic partners.

Data sources are connected into Data 360 via a connector that ingests data into Data 360 or through zero-copy data federation which syncs data from external sources to Data 360.

After data is manipulated, harmonized, or segmented in Data 360, data can be sent to targets such as an SFTP or shared with integrations, such as Snowflake.

Some connectors offer the ability to connect data into Data 360, others allows share of data out of Data 360, and others offer bidirectional functionality.

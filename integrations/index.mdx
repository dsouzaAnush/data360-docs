# Data 360 Integrations

<Note>
As of October 14, 2025, Data Cloud has been rebranded to **Data 360**. During this transition, you may see references to Data Cloud in our application and documentation.
</Note>

Data sources connect into Data 360 via connectors that ingest data, or through zero-copy data federation which syncs data from external sources. After data is harmonized and segmented, it can be sent to targets or shared with integration partners.

# Create a Data Stream

Data streams define how ingested data maps into Data 360 objects. Each stream corresponds to one schema object and controls the primary key, category, and refresh behavior.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Connector status | **Needs Data Stream** or **In Use** — see [Ingestion API Setup](/integrations/ingestion-api-setup) |
| Schema uploaded | At least one object defined — see [Schema Requirements](/integrations/schema-requirements) |

## Create a Data Stream

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Your Connector">
    In Data Cloud Setup, go to **Ingestion API** and select your connector. Click **Create Data Stream**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Schema Object">
    Choose the schema object you want to create a stream for (e.g., `Customer`, `OrderEvent`).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Primary Key">
    Select the field that uniquely identifies each record. This is used for deduplication and upsert operations.

    ```text Example
    Primary Key: CustomerId
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Category">
    Assign a data category that determines how Data 360 processes the stream:

    | Category | Use For | Processing |
    |----------|---------|------------|
    | **Profile** | Customer/account master data | Upsert by primary key |
    | **Engagement** | Events, interactions, activities | Time-series append |
    | **Other** | Reference data, lookup tables | Upsert by primary key |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Refresh Mode">
    Choose how records are updated when new data arrives:

    | Mode | Behavior | Best For |
    |------|----------|----------|
    | **Full** | Replaces all existing records with new payload | Complete data snapshots |
    | **Incremental** | Upserts by primary key, all fields required | Regular updates with full records |
    | **Partial** | Upserts by primary key, only sent fields updated | Sparse updates to specific fields |

    <Warning>
    Refresh mode is **immutable after creation**. You cannot change it once the data stream is deployed. Choose carefully.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Event Time Field (Engagement only)">
    For **Engagement** category streams, select the `date-time` field to use as the event timestamp.

    <Note>
    This field must have `format: date-time` in your schema. It determines the event ordering for time-series processing.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Configuration">
    Confirm all settings — primary key, category, refresh mode, and event time field (if applicable).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy">
    Click **Deploy** to activate the data stream. The connector status transitions to **In Use**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Post-Deployment

<Note>
After deployment, it takes approximately **1 hour** for the data stream to be fully provisioned and ready to receive data. Data may take additional time to appear in queries.
</Note>

### Verify Your Data Stream

Once data has been ingested, run a quick query to confirm records are flowing:

```sql verify_stream.sql icon=database
SELECT COUNT(*) as record_count
FROM   Customer_Stream__dll
WHERE  ssot__CreatedDate__c > DATEADD(hour, -24, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
```

### Send Test Data

Use the streaming endpoint to send a test record. See [Data Ingestion API](/apis/connect-api/data-ingestion) for full endpoint details.

```bash test_ingest.sh icon=terminal
curl -X POST "https://{instance}.salesforce.com/services/data/v64.0/ssot/streaming/{streamName}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "data": [{
      "CustomerId": "TEST_001",
      "FirstName": "Test",
      "LastName": "User",
      "Email": "test@example.com"
    }]
  }'
```
